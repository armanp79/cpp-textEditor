// Project #4: People Just Love to Play with Words
//
// The EditorModel class implements the "model" of BooEdit.  In other words, its
// job is to maintain the underlying data -- the current lines of text, where
// the cursor is supposed to be, etc. -- and provide operations that allow the
// EditorView to access that data, along with basic operations that allow the
// various Command objects to make the necessary changes when they're executed
// or undone.
//
// The member functions already declared in the EditorModel class are absolutely
// necessary for EditorView to work, so they cannot be removed or have their
// declarations changed (though you may need to implement them; see
// EditorModel.cpp).
//
// You will absolutely need to implement additional member functions, because I
// haven't declared any functions that change the editor's data (e.g., by
// inserting characters, moving the cursor), which you'll need in order to
// implement the various Command objects.  You may also need additional member
// functions that access the editor's data in ways not provided here.
//
// When adding member functions, focus on adding "primitive" tools that you
// might be able to use in multiple command implementations.  Don't just add
// one member function for each command; that's tying your design to the
// specifics of the commands you chose, which makes it more difficult to
// change your mind about which commands you want without having a cascading
// effect here.
//
// The EditorModel class is unaware of the concept of "undo"; it is the job of
// the Command objects to know what they need to do in order to undo a Command.
// This may mean that your Command objects will need to store information in
// member variables after execute() is finished, so that information will still
// be available at the time undo() is called.
//
// Note that the notion of "line number" and "column number" here is one-based,
// not zero-based, which means that the top left corner of the file is line 1
// column 1.  You can handle this however you'd like inside of your class, but
// the rest of BooEdit expects Editor objects to take and return one-based
// line and column numbers.
